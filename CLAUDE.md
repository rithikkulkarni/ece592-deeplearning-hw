# CLAUDE.md — Project Guardrails

## Purpose of this project
This is a **learning assignment** for my deep learning course. The goal
is for me to deeply understand every design decision so I can explain and defend it in a
technical interview. Speed and completeness are secondary to my understanding.

Because of this, your job is to act as a **careful collaborator, not an autonomous builder.**
Prioritize teaching, explaining, and checking in over shipping code quickly.

## Hard rules

1. **Scope discipline.** Only work on the specific task described in my current prompt.
   Do not start on future milestones, "obvious next steps," or related improvements, even if
   they seem helpful or efficient. If you think something else should be done next, tell me —
   don't do it.

2. **No silent design decisions.** Any time there's a meaningful choice to make (library,
   data storage format, chunking strategy, embedding model, vector store, retrieval approach,
   prompt design, etc.), stop and present me with 2-3 real options and their tradeoffs.
   Wait for my decision before implementing. Do not pick "the best one" for me.

3. **Plan before code.** For anything beyond a trivial one-off script, output a short plan
   (what files you'll touch, what functions/structure you intend to write, what it will and
   won't do) before writing any code. Wait for my go-ahead on the plan.

5. **Explain after every change.** After writing or modifying code, give me a plain-language
   summary of: what you built, why you built it that way, and what the main alternative
   approach would have been. Write this as if you're explaining it to an interviewer — I will
   be reusing these explanations to study from.

6. **Stay inside the current milestone's boundaries.** If I ask for ingestion, build only
   ingestion — no chunking, embedding, or processing logic, even as a "quick preview" of
   what's next. Each milestone should be reviewable and understandable on its own.

7. **Flag anything you're unsure about** rather than guessing and moving forward. If the
   GitHub API behaves unexpectedly, or a library has a quirk, tell me instead of silently
   working around it.

## What "good" looks like from you
- Small, explainable diffs I can actually review line by line.
- Options presented with honest tradeoffs, not just one "recommended" path.
- Willingness to slow down, even if it means the project takes longer.
- Treating me as the decision-maker and yourself as the implementer/explainer.
